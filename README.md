# Spotify-Music-Recommender-System

## Description
The obejctive of this project is to learn and implement **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** algorithm by building a simple music recommendation system. The recommender system suggests **top 5 songs** based on a given track, using audio features and similarity metrics.

---

## Workflow
This project follows these main steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning and preparing the dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – identifying distributions and correlations of variables
3. **Model Building** – implementing a kNN model
4. **Generating Recommendations**

## Packages
The project uses the following Python packages:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import regex as re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sb

from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors```

## DataSet
Spotify 1 Million Tracks data from Kaggle
